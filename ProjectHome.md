For example, you need to display an article, it has title, the contents of two parts.We tend to use two TextView to display them and give them different properties, so that users can distinguish between title and content.In fact, we can define a Title controls and a Content control, they were to extended the TextView, but their property has been for the Android mobile phone by the programmer to set up (including but not limited to the width, height, position).We can only use a few parameters (such as a contentString) to create a suitable control.
